# What even is this project?

This project started as a way to get more familiar with the Canvas API and evolved into game making playground. I use it to test some gamedev concepts, experiment and have fun! It's currently a work in progress and I plan to make one complete level of the game. The level will consist of fighting a horde of enemies and a final boss.
